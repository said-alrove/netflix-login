This is the sixth project from Juan Pablo's course of [CSS Grid and Flexbox](https://www.udemy.com/course/css-grid-y-flexbox-la-guia-definitiva-crea-10-proyectos/).

> **Disclaimer:** I'm starting to learn how to use **Git/Github** correctly, therefore there'll be plenty of pull requests, commits and other stuff as tests in this repository, however, *this won't represent my way of working forever*, I'll learn more things along the way as always :D!.
